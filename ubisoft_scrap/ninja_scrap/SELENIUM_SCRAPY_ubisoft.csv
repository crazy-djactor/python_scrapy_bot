","We are building an original AAA game set in the world of James Cameron’s
Avatar and we are excited to allow players to explore Pandora. To make this
happen, we are looking for a Level Design Director to help us create the
beautiful and dangerous moon of Pandora.

As a Level Design Director, you oversee the content and quality of the level
design of the game. Day to day you work closely with the Game Director to
ensure that the experience synergizes with the Creative Directors’ vision. You
also work closely with the Mission Director and the Open World Director to
ensure that all fields have adequate support to reach the high-quality bar and
immersive worlds we are known for at Massive

 **This is a permanent position based in Malmö, Sweden, and requires working
onsite. We kindly ask you to apply with your CV and message to the hiring
manager / cover letter in English. Applications will be reviewed whilst the
job-ad is posted.**  
  
 **Responsibilities**

  * Developing the level design vision and overseeing that the vision is carried through into the game, with the player and their experience in the center
  * Considering, evangelizing and overseeing rules and metrics for gameplay spaces (rational level design)
  * Making sure that all the gameplay spaces work flawlessly
  * Validation of the work carried out by the team to ensure that quality objectives are met and that the elements are in line with the level design vision for the game, especially through iterative reviews to test the player experience

","**You as a person**

any type of experience for the player. Your long-standing experience in level
editors makes you able to constantly reflect on how you can push the envelope
of level design when it comes to immersion and fun. You make your voice seen
and your vision heard by using your positive communication style – which
brings enthusiasm and energy both up and down the food chain. Over the years
you have come to understand and respect the unique role that world and level
design has: You and your team is the “voice” of all other departments (art,
systems design, animation etc.) since you take all the components and assemble
them into the final world in which the players have their experiences. This
unique role requires humility, attentiveness, service mindedness and quite a
bit of patience.

Besides the above we’re looking for someone with experience within the
following areas:

  * Extensive knowledge about level design principles across most AAA genres
  * 10+ years’ experience making video games, with at least 8 years’ experience as a level designer or similar
  * At least one shipped game in a senior or lead position
  * At least one shipped AAA game as a Lead Level Designer or similar
